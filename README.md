SIR Model (system of differential equations to track the spread of a virus in epidemiology using the population of susceptible, infected, and recovered entities).

Quick project where I taught undergraduates how to solve differential equations in Python, along with a few other methods. I then had them build their own SIR model 
for the spread of Covid-19 on campus.
